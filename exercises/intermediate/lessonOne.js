//Analysis of Algorithms - the theoretical study of computer performance and resource usage.
//What's more important than performance - simplicity, user-friendliness, features, modularity, security, etc.
//Why study algorithms? - measures the line b/w the feasible and infeasible..if something uses too much memory,
//it won't work.
//Problem Sorting
//Problem 1 = Input Sequence < a1, a2, ..., an > of numbers. Output is permutation (rearrangement) of those numbers.
//such that a1 <= a2 <= <= an

//Insertion Sort - Insertion Sort (A1a) -- Sorts A[1..n]
